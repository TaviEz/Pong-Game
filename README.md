# Pong-Game

The project is a console Pong Game written in C++ using classes, methods, for loops, while loops and also swtich statements.
I chose to structure the code into 3 main classes: cBall, cPaddle and cGameManager.
The cBall class contains methods for its movement using the enum direction which can take values from 0 to 6(line 7 in the source.cpp)

The paddles are made from the "\xDB" character and the borders from the "\xB2" character.
The controls for the left paddle are "W" and "S" and for the right paddle are "o" and "l". If you want different controls just change the 156-159 lines to your preference.
